This is my first developed GAME as part of my curriculum ,PGD-101 :: C Programming ,at Jahangirnagar University
This is a simple game which randomly generate integer value in every second and let user guess the number.
For simplicity and good user experience I set the random number between 1 and 100.
Since I am a beginner ,I would love to have suggestions and debugging recommendation
